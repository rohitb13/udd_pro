We can divide our project into 4 parts.

1)Autosar
    
Application layer
RTE layer
BSW layer

2)Application layer
It contain multiple SWCs.and they are connected through interfaces.

3)UDD
We are developing a software called UDD (Unified Design Dictionary).
Basically in UDD we are creating multiple SWCs which is a part of Autosar application layer. In this way UDD project is related to Autoar.

In Swc creation we need to create ports so that they can interact with the different SWCs or BSW.
Read about runnable and runnable resource access it is related to autosar and port. As Runnable resurce access provides the access to the ports to transceive the data
through ports
Calibration is the process of configuring an instrument to provide a result for a sample within an acceptable range. The instrument can then provide more accurate 
results when samples of unknown values are tested in the normal usage of the product.

Read about Private data, Caliberation and multiple RTE (Runtime Environment) events occured.

Read about multiple interfaces & Enum and all GR elements.

Later On as every industry is moving towards agile so UDD also moves towards agile and then Stream and Multiapp concept comes into place.
Stream is used to save individual data in particulaer and also allow to give and take with the others ones.
Multiapp is used to use different application at the same time but by different user to create new functionality according to the market requirement.

4)inport Export

We can import data into UDD from the Client server.
We can export data from UDD
While exporting two types of file will be generated Arxml and csv.
Arxml directly imported into matlab and we can view the structure created in UDD.
Csv file should be converted into .m file through mscripting and then can be import.

Final thing that UDD is integrated with the MATLAB and SystemDesk.
